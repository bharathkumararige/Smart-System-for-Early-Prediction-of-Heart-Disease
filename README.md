# Smart-System-for-Early-Prediction-of-Heart-Disease
This project aims to build a machine learning-based system that predicts whether a person is likely to develop heart disease based on clinical and demographic information. The model leverages a Random Forest Classifier, trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset, to provide accurate and interpretable results.
